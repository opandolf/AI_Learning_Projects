# Datascience X Logistic Regression

Project where the aim is to do the Hogwart Sorting hat's job, select for a student his house using data about them.
A training and test dataset is given.  
The project is divided in 2 parts: data exploration and logistic regression classifier implementation.  
  
Data Science part:  
  + describe.py : recoding of pandas.describe() method  
  + histogram.py, scatter.py and pair_plot.py : data visualisation with some graphs of matplotlib library  
  
Multinomial Logistic Regression Classifier:  
  + logreg_predict.py : take dataset in argument and save a prediction in house.csv using weights.csv  
  + logreg_train.py : take dataset in argument and train weights saving it in weight.csv file  
  
# Usage
