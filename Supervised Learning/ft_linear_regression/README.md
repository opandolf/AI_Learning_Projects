# Linear Regression

This is my first Machine Learning school project. I had to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
Divided in 2 files:
  + prediction.py : predict a price using theta.csv file as weights and mileage given by user.
  + training.py : train weights using data.csv as training set store the trained weights in theta.csv file.
