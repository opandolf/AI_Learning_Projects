# TICTACTOE

This is my implementation of alphazero algorithm to tictactoe game.  
I used this easy game to study [**Deepmind's Algorithm**](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch).
This was easier thanks to David Foster's [**cheat sheet**](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0) and Surag Nair [**MCTS**](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html) implementation in python and explanations.
