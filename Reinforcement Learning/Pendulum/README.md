# Pendulum

I have done this project to be confronted with countinuous action space challenge with deeplearning.
I used actor critic [**Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf).

I used [**Yash Patel work**](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-w-keras-openai-actor-critic-models-f084612cfd69) to understand the algorithm guidelines.
