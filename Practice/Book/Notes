MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data

USE OF MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning is great for:
    - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules
    - Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach
    - Fluctuating environments
    - Getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS
    - supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, Reinforcement Learning
    - online versus batch learning
    - instance-based versus model-based learning

SUPERVISED LEARNING
    In supervised Learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called Labels
    Common tasks : 
        - Classification
        - Regression
    
    Most important supervised learning algorithms:
        - K-nearest neighbors
        - Linear Regression
        - Logistic Regression
        - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
        - Decision Trees and Random Forests
        - Neural networks
    
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

    Clustering:
        K-Means
        Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
        Expectation Maximisation
    Visualization and dimensionality reduction
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        Kernel PCA
        Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
        t-distributed Stochastic neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    Association rule Learning
        Apriori
        Eclat
    
BATCH LEARNING
    In batch Learning, the system is incapable of learning inscrementally: it must be train using all the available data

ONLINE LEARNING
    In online learning, you train the system inscrementally by feedsing it data instances sequentially. either individually or by small groups called mini-batches
    Can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine's main memory (this is called out-of-core learning)
INSTANCE BASED LEARNING
    The system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases using a similarity measure

MODEL BASED LEARNING
    Build a model of these examples, then use that model to make predictions

    steps to solve a model-based project:
        - study the data
        - select a model
        - train the model on the training data
        - apply the model to make predictions on new cases (inference)

MAIN CHALLENGES OF MACHINE LEARNING
    insufficient Quantity of training data
    non representative training data
    Poor quality data
    Irrelevant features
    Overfitting Training data
    underfitting the training data
    Stepping Back
